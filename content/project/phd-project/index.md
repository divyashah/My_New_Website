### Robot Design for Dexterous Manipulation.

This research project is a part of the Ph.D. with [Dipartimento di Informatica, Bioingegneria, Robtoica e Ingegneria dei Sistemi (DIBRIS)](http://phd.dibris.unige.it/biorob/) at the Università degli Studi di Genova and in affiliation with the [iCub Tech](https://www.iit.it/research/facilities/icub-tech) at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia in Genova, Italy. The Ph.D. thesis is aimed towards design of a new wrist for the [iCub humanoid](https://icub.org/) with enhanced manipulation dexterity. The main focus here is the study and implementation of parallel orientational mechanisms.

#### Objectives

- To study and investigate the state-of-the-art in design for wrist dexterity.
- To adapt and analyze some of the most promising architectures from the literature.
- To propose a novel kinematic design for the wrist with enhanced dexterity.
- To test and develop the proposed mechanism.
