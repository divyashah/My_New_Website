### Robot Design for Dexterous Manipulation.

This research project is a part of the Ph.D. with Dipartimento di Informatica, Bioingegneria, Robtoica e Ingegneria dei Sistemi ([DIBRIS](http://phd.dibris.unige.it/biorob/)) at the Universit√† degli Studi di Genova and in affiliation with the [iCub Tech](https://www.iit.it/research/lines/icub) at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia in Genova, Italy. The Ph.D. thesis is aimed towards design and development of a new wrist for the iCub humanoid for dexterous manipulation. The main focus here is the study and implementation of parallel kinematic mechanisms.

#### Objectives

- To study and investigate the state-of-the-art in design for wrist dexterity.
- To adapt and analyze some of the most promising architectures from the literature.
- To propose a novel kinematic design for the wrist with improved dexterity.
- To test and develop the proposed mechanism.
- To integrate the new wrist on the iCub platform.

#### Supervisors

- **Alberto Parmiggiani**; Technologist & Facility Coordinator, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia
- **Giorgio Metta**; Scientific Director, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia
