This is the PhD project with the aim of design and development of a new wrist for the iCub humanoid for dexterous manipulation. The main focus here is the study and implementation of parallel kinematic mechanisms.

The general objectives for the project are as follows:

- To study and investigate the state-of-the-art in design for wrist dexterity.
- To adapt and analyze some of the most promising architectures from the literature.
- To propose a novel kinematic design for the wrist with improved dexterity.
- To test and develop the proposed mechanism.
- To integrate the new wrist on the iCub platform.
