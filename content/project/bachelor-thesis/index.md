### Design, Fabrication and Control of an Articulated Robotic Arm

This was the bachelor thesis project during the under-graduate study at [Sardar Patel College of Engineering](http://spce.ac.in/), an autonomous institute affiliated to the University of Mumbai, India.  

The thesis involved a detailed study of mechanical design, fabrication, kinematic control and performance analysis for a 6 degrees of freedom articulated robotic arm and development of a prototype to demonstrate basic manipulation of objects.
