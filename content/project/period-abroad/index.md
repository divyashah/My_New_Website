## Design of Pronation-Supination Joint with Tendon Decoupling

This is a draft project page for the period-abroad during the PhD at the Interactive Robotics and Innovative Mechanism ([IRIM](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj1NluENvVHth1V74dohlcw)) Lab at Korea University of Technology and Education ([KOREATECH](https://www.koreatech.ac.kr/eng.do)) in Cheonan, South Korea.

The collaborative project was about the concept design and prototyping for a pronation-supination (forearm) joint mechanism with multiple tendon routing and allowing decoupled motions.
