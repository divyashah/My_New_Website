## Design of Pronation-Supination Joint with Tendon Decoupling

This research project was a part of the period-abroad during the PhD, from July to October 2019. It was achieved in collaboration with the [Interactive Robotics and Innovative Mechanism (IRIM)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj1NluENvVHth1V74dohlcw) Lab at [Korea University of Technology and Education (KOREATECH)](https://www.koreatech.ac.kr/eng.do) in Cheonan, South Korea. The project involved concept design and prototyping for a pronation-supination (forearm) joint mechanism with multiple tendon routings to allow for decoupled motions.
