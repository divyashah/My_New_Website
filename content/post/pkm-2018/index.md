### Summer School on Parallel Kinematic Machines

The goal of the summer school [PKM 2018](http://www.lirmm.fr/pkm-2018/index.html) was to share the knowledge on parallel kinematics machines (PKM) during a whole week, targeting realistic prototypes to face real problems met in the industry.

Various lectures and simulation labs were conducted covering the topics of design, kinematics, dynamics, control strategies, visual servoing for the PKMs with a special focus on cable-driven parallel robots.

All the student participants were asked to present their related research problems through posters and further share and discuss the solutions toward the same.

The poster presented at the summer school can be downloaded from the following link:
