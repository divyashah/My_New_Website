summary: Poster presentation on robot design for dexterous manipulation.
abstract: "The goal of this summer school was to share the knowledge on parallel kinematics manipulators (PKM) during a whole week, targeting realistic prototypes to face real problems met in the industry. Various lectures and simulation labs were conducted covering the topics of design, kinematics, dynamics, control strategies, visual servoing for the PKMs with a special focus on cable-driven parallel robots. All the student participants were asked to present their related research problems through posters and further share and discuss the solutions toward the same."
