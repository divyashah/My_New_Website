summary: Poster presentation on robot design for dexterous manipulation.
abstract: "More details to follow ..."

#"ROBOzen is oriented to PhD students, young researchers and specialists working in the design of mechanisms and motion planning techniques for robotic and related mechatronic applications.
#International and Italian experts will give lectures in the following topics:
#– Compliant and flexible mechanisms for robotics
#– Parallel and Cable-driven mechanisms for robotics
#– Trajectory planning for robotics
#– Collaborative robots
#– Mobile robots
#All the student participants were asked to present their related research problems through posters and further share and discuss the solutions toward the same."


# Talk start and end times.
#   End time can optionally be hidden by prefixing the line with `#`.
