Divya Shah received his B. Tech degree in mechanical engineering from [Sardar Patel College of Engineering](http://spce.ac.in/) affiliated to the [Mumbai University](http://mu.ac.in/), India in 2015. His active involvement with the [collegiate robotics club](https://www.facebook.com/RoboconSPCE.In/) during his undergrad, aspired him to pursue higher education in robotics which brought him to Europe.  

He then, graduated from the [Erasmus+ European Masters on Advanced Robotics (EMARO+)](http://masteremaro.irccyn.ec-nantes.fr/index.php/welcome) with double M.Sc. degrees from the [Università degli Studi di Genova](https://unige.it/), Italy and [École Centrale de Nantes](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/), France in 2017. For his graduate thesis, he worked on CAD design and optimization of a redundant robotics workcell for automated fiber placement process.

Currently, he is a PhD student with [iCub Tech](https://www.iit.it/research/lines/icub) at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) and the [Dipartimento di Informatica, Bioingegneria, Robtoica e Ingegneria dei Sistemi (DIBRIS)](http://phd.dibris.unige.it/biorob/) at Università degli Studi di Genova, Italy. His research focuses on mechanism design, kinematics, parallel robots and tendon-driven mechanisms aiming for dexterous manipulation for humanoids.
