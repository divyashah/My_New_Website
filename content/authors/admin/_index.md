I am Indian, born and brought up in Mumbai. I received my B. Tech degree in mechanical engineering from [Sardar Patel College of Engineering](http://spce.ac.in/) affiliated to the [Mumbai University](http://mu.ac.in/) in 2015. My active involvement with the [collegiate robotics club](https://www.facebook.com/RoboconSPCE.In/) during my undergrad, aspired me to pursue higher education in robotics.  

I then moved to Europe and graduated from the [Erasmus+ European Masters on Advanced Robotics (EMARO+)](http://masteremaro.irccyn.ec-nantes.fr/index.php/welcome) with double M.Sc. degrees from the [Università degli Studi di Genova](https://unige.it/), Italy and [École Centrale de Nantes](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/), France in 2017. For my graduate thesis, I worked on CAD design and optimization of a redundant robotics workcell for automated fiber placement process.

Currently, I am a third year PhD student with [iCub Tech](https://www.iit.it/research/lines/icub) at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) and [Dipartimento di Informatica, Bioingegneria, Robotica e Ingegneria dei Sistemi (DIBRIS)](http://phd.dibris.unige.it/biorob/) at Università degli Studi di Genova, Italy. My research focuses on mechanism design, parallel kinematics and tendon-driven mechanisms aiming for dexterous manipulation for humanoid robots.

My detailed CV is available  {{% staticref "files/cv.pdf" "newtab" %}} here{{% /staticref %}}.

In my spare time, I learn and practice swing dancing!
